# Learning CSS & Layout plus JavaScript in a Gallery.
Make a site look like a site.

This was my first foray into front-end development. I learned syntax and best-practices when working with style sheets and layouts. I was introduced to the box model. It was good to learn how to make a site responsive. 

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> also came into play here, a static site generator that gave me a layout to work from, and where I was introduced to Liquid.  

JavaScript came into play to improve the UI of the image gallery.
