# My Website.
Building my first website -- something functional to serve as my personal dev site.

This was my first foray into front-end development and using CSS and layout. Used some box model. Added a little JavaScript 

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> also came into play here, a static site generator that gave me a layout to work from, and where I was introduced to Liquid.
