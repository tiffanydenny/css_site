# A basic website.
I built this during a tutorial to learn CSS and JavaScript, and it is standing in for my portfolio site, currently being built in React. 

This was my first foray into front-end development and using CSS and layout. Used some box model. Added a little JavaScript 

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> also came into play here, a static site generator that gave me a layout to work from, and where I was introduced to Liquid.
