          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the
          world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard
          skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft
           skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
          knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
          benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join
