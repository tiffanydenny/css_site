           data-description="This will be an app to support to work of ELM facilitators. I plan to build it in Rails and React. Currently it is a framework that basically handles login and authentication, but I hope to add features using Unsplash and other stock photo APIs to find relevant and diverse images for the organization. Additionally, it will be a home for continuing education content, and will allow facilitators to enter certain information about their programs to automatically generate on-brand marketing materials.">
